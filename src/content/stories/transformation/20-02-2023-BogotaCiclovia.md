# Bogotá's Ciclovía

Every Sunday and holiday in Bogotá, Colombia, a remarkable transformation takes place. More than 120 kilometers of city streets—normally dominated by cars and buses—become completely car-free from 7am to 2pm. This event, known as Ciclovía (Spanish for "cycleway"), attracts up to 1.7 million people each week to walk, cycle, dance, and exercise in public space normally dominated by motor vehicles.

## The Challenge

In the 1970s, Bogotá faced growing congestion, pollution, and unequal access to recreational space. Most residents had limited access to parks, while streets prioritized private car owners who represented a minority of the population. The city needed to reclaim public space for the majority of residents who relied on other modes of transportation.

## Our Approach

What began as a small demonstration in December 1974 has evolved into a nationwide phenomenon that has inspired similar programs in more than 100 cities around the world, from Los Angeles to Mexico City to Brussels.

"Ciclovía wasn't just about creating recreational space—it was about democratizing our streets," explains Ricardo Montezuma, an urban mobility expert and historian of the program. "It helped people reimagine what our city could be."

## Implementation Strategy

The program gained significant momentum under Mayor Enrique Peñalosa (1998-2001, 2016-2019), who expanded Ciclovía as part of a broader transformation of Bogotá's transportation system. This included creating TransMilenio, a bus rapid transit system, and building an extensive network of permanent bicycle infrastructure.

## The Results

Research has documented numerous benefits from Ciclovía:

- Physical activity equivalent to 41% of weekly recommended exercise for participants
- Significant air quality improvements during Ciclovía hours
- Economic benefits for small vendors and businesses along the routes
- Enhanced social cohesion across socioeconomic boundaries

Perhaps most importantly, Ciclovía helped shift the culture and politics of transportation in Bogotá. What was once seen as radical is now a beloved institution that transcends political divisions.

"Ciclovía shows us that transforming urban mobility isn't just about infrastructure—it's about creating experiences that change how people think about public space," Montezuma notes. "Once people experience streets as public spaces rather than just traffic corridors, it's hard to go back."
