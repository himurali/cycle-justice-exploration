# Safe Streets Initiative  at Portland

By Sarah Chen, Urban Planner

When I first started working as an urban planner in downtown Seattle, our streets were dominated by cars. Pedestrians and cyclists were an afterthought, squeezed into narrow sidewalks and unprotected bike lanes. But we had a vision: to transform our downtown into a place where people, not vehicles, took center stage.

## The Challenge

Our biggest challenge wasn't technical – it was cultural. Many business owners worried that removing parking spaces would hurt their bottom line. Commuters feared increased traffic congestion. We needed to prove that prioritizing cycling and walking could actually improve business and reduce congestion.

## Our Approach

We started small, with weekend street closures and temporary bike lanes. We collected data on foot traffic, business revenue, and travel times. The results were compelling: businesses saw a 15% increase in revenue during car-free days, and traffic flow actually improved as more people chose to walk or cycle.

## Community Engagement

The most crucial element was involving the community at every step. We organized walking tours, public forums, and design workshops. Residents contributed ideas for street furniture, public art, and green spaces. This collaborative approach transformed skeptics into advocates.

## The Results

Today, our downtown features wide pedestrian plazas, protected bike lanes, and vibrant street life. Carbon emissions are down 22%, local businesses are thriving, and the area has become a destination for both residents and tourists. But the greatest achievement isn't physical – it's the cultural shift. Our community now sees streets as public spaces for people, not just corridors for cars.
