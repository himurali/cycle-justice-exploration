## Fighting for Bicycle Commuting Rights

When Maria Gonzalez began commuting by bicycle to her downtown law office in 2018, she quickly realized that cyclists operated in a precarious legal environment. After experiencing several close calls and witnessing a fellow cyclist's accident, Gonzalez decided to use her legal expertise to address these systemic issues.

## The Challenge

"The problem wasn't just infrastructureâ€”it was that the legal system itself wasn't adequately protecting vulnerable road users," Gonzalez explains. The existing laws failed to recognize the unique needs and vulnerabilities of cyclists, leaving them with little recourse after accidents and minimal protection on the roads.

## Our Approach

Over the next three years, Gonzalez worked pro bono to establish precedent-setting cases that:

- Clarified cyclists' right-of-way at unmarked intersections
- Established higher duty-of-care standards for motorists around cyclists
- Created legal pathways for cyclists to seek damages for infrastructure-related injuries

## Community Impact

Her biggest victory came in 2022 with the landmark case of *Rodriguez v. City Transit Authority*, which established that public transit agencies must provide safe passage alternatives during construction projects that disrupt bicycle lanes.

"Before this ruling, agencies could simply post a 'Bike Lane Closed' sign with no alternative route," Gonzalez notes. "Now they have a legal obligation to maintain safe cycling routes during construction."

## The Results

Gonzalez has since founded the Cycling Justice Project, which provides legal assistance to cyclists and advocates for stronger legal protections. Her work has directly influenced municipal policies in three major cities, with more considering similar reforms.

"This is about recognizing that our transportation systems should protect all users, not just those in cars," says Gonzalez. "The law needs to catch up to that reality."
